<h1>1)    Mathematical Basics</h1>

Use set theory and the definition of probability functions to show that:

<em>P</em>(<em>A </em>∪ <em>B</em>) = <em>P</em>(<em>A</em>)+ <em>P</em>(<em>B</em>)− <em>P</em>(<em>A </em>∩ <em>B</em>)

<h1>2)     Indepedence of Events</h1>

Consider a fair 6-sided die whose sides are numbered from 1 to 6 and each die roll is independent of the other rolls. In an experiment that consists of rolling the die twice, the following events can be defined

<ul>

 <li>: The sum of the two outcomes is at least 10</li>

 <li>: At least one of the two rolls resulted in 6 <em>C </em>:        At least one of the two rolls resulted in 1</li>

</ul>

<em>D </em>:        The outcome of the 2nd roll was higher than the 1st roll <em>E </em>: The difference between the two roll outcomes is exactly 1

<ul>

 <li>Compute the probabilities P(<em>A</em>), P(<em>C</em>), and P(<em>E</em>).</li>

 <li>Is event <em>A </em>independent of event <em>B</em>? (c) Is event <em>A </em>independent of event <em>C</em>?</li>

</ul>

(d) Are events <em>D </em>and <em>E </em>independent?

<h1>3)     Bayes Theorem</h1>

Suppose we are interested in a test to detect a disease which affects one in 100<em>,</em>000 people on average. A lab has developed a test which works but is not perfect. If a person has the disease, it will give a positive result with probability 0<em>.</em>97; if they do not, the test will be positive with probability 0<em>.</em>007. You took the test, and it gave a positive result. What is the probability that you actually have the disease?

<h1>4)     Random Variables</h1>

Are <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>, as defined in the following table, independently distributed? How did you check?

<table width="304">

 <tbody>

  <tr>

   <td width="129"><em>x</em></td>

   <td width="175">0           0         1           1</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="129"><em>y</em></td>

   <td width="175">0           1         0           1</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="129"><em>p</em>(<em>X </em>= <em>x,Y </em>= <em>y</em>)</td>

   <td width="175">0<em>.</em>32 0<em>.</em>08 0<em>.</em>48 0<em>.</em>12</td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>
